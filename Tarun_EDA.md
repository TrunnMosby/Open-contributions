# What is EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)?
EDA is a process of getting to know the data well. It includes many things like checking the missing values, count, mean, standard deviation, whether the data is normalized or 
not,visualizing the data, checking for outliers, checking the correlation between different features, checking for the different data types of features, etc.

## Why EDA should be performed?
 EDA is a very important step that needs to be performed at the beginning.  
* EDA helps us to visualize and understand the data better.
* EDA helps us to check for missing values and what technique should be used to fill them.
* EDA helps us to how important a particular feature is to us and whether or not to include that feature while training our model.
* EDA also helps us to generate new features from the existing ones that increase the efficiency of our models.
* EDA helps us to understand how much one feature is related to other.
 
Some basic plots 
* Count Plot-
It helps us to visualize the count each variable

* Box Plot-
 It is used to show the shape of the distribution, its central value, and its variability.

* Dist Plot-
It depicts the distribution of data

* Scatter Plot-
 It depicts how one variable is affected by other

* Heat maps- It depicts how one variable is dependent on another and showcases it using different colours.
